      <h2>💻 Why is my computer so slow?</h2>
      <p>Most slow computers are caused by background programs, too many startup apps, or lack of updates. Try the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Restart your computer at least once a day</li>
        <li>Uninstall apps you don’t use anymore</li>
        <li>Don’t click on pop-ups or ads offering to "clean" your PC</li>
        <li>If unsure, contact me and I can speed it up safely</li>
      </ul>
